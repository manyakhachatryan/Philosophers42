# Philosophers
## I never thought philosophy would be so deadly

### Summary:
In this project, you will learn the basics of threading a process. \
You will see how to create threads and you will discover mutexes.

## Chapter I
### Introduction
 • Philosophy (from Greek, philosophia, literally "love of wisdom") is the study of general
and fundamental questions about existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. Such questions are often posed as problems to be studied or resolved. The term
was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 – 495 BCE). Philosophical methods include
questioning, critical discussion, rational argument, and systematic presentation.\
•  Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove
it? What is most real? Philosophers also pose more practical and concrete questions such
as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with
it)? Do humans have free will? \
•  Historically, "philosophy" encompassed any body of knowledge. From the time of Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle to the 19th century, "natural philosophy" encompassed
astronomy, medicine, and physics. For example, Newton’s 1687 Mathematical Principles
of Natural Philosophy later became classified as a book of physics.  \
• In the 19th century, the growth of modern research universities led academic philosophy and other disciplines to professionalize and specialize. In the modern era, some
investigations that were traditionally part of philosophy became separate academic disciplines, including psychology, sociology, linguistics, and economics. \
•  Other investigations closely related to art, science, politics, or other pursuits remained
part of philosophy. For example, is beauty objective or subjective? Are there many scientific methods or just one? Is political utopia a hopeful dream or hopeless fantasy?
Major sub-fields of academic philosophy include metaphysics ("concerned with the fundamental nature of reality and being"), epistemology (about the "nature and grounds of
knowledge [and]... its limits and validity"), ethics, aesthetics, political philosophy, logic
and philosophy of science.

### Common Instructions
• Your project must be written in C. \
• Your project must be written in accordance with the Norm. If you have bonus \
files/functions, they are included in the norm check and you will receive a 0 if there
is a norm error inside. \
• Your functions should not quit unexpectedly (segmentation fault, bus error, double
free, etc) apart from undefined behaviors. If this happens, your project will be
considered non functional and will receive a 0 during the evaluation. \
• All heap allocated memory space must be properly freed when necessary. No leaks
will be tolerated. \
• If the subject requires it, you must submit a Makefile which will compile your
source files to the required output with the flags -Wall, -Wextra and -Werror, use
cc, and your Makefile must not relink. \
• Your Makefile must at least contain the rules $(NAME), all, clean, fclean and
re. \
• To turn in bonuses to your project, you must include a rule bonus to your Makefile,
which will add all the various headers, librairies or functions that are forbidden on
the main part of the project. Bonuses must be in a different file _bonus.{c/h} if
the subject does not specify anything else. Mandatory and bonus part evaluation
is done separately. \
• If your project allows you to use your libft, you must copy its sources and its
associated Makefile in a libft folder with its associated Makefile. Your project’s
Makefile must compile the library by using its Makefile, then compile the project. \
• We encourage you to create test programs for your project even though this work
won’t have to be submitted and won’t be graded. It will give you a chance
to easily test your work and your peers’ work. You will find those tests especially
useful during your defence. Indeed, during defence, you are free to use your tests
and/or the tests of the peer you are evaluating.
